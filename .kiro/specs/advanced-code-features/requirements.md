# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing app generator with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration and advanced tool calling capabilities. The goal is to enable the AI to access external tools and services through MCP, allowing for dynamic data fetching, API integrations, and enhanced code generation that can interact with real-world services and databases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the app generator, I want the AI to integrate MCP tool calling capabilities, so that generated applications can dynamically fetch data from external APIs, databases, and services during the code generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates code that requires external data THEN the system SHALL automatically identify and configure appropriate MCP tools for data fetching
2. WHEN MCP tools are available THEN the system SHALL present users with options to integrate real data sources into their generated applications
3. WHEN a user requests integration with specific services (databases, APIs, etc.) THEN the system SHALL use MCP tools to establish connections and generate appropriate integration code
4. WHEN MCP tool calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle authentication, error handling, and data transformation automatically
5. WHEN external data is fetched THEN the system SHALL generate TypeScript interfaces that match the actual data structure returned by the MCP tools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer building data-driven applications, I want the app generator to use MCP tools to connect to real databases and APIs, so that my generated code works with actual data instead of mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating applications that need database connectivity THEN the system SHALL use MCP database tools to establish connections and generate appropriate queries
2. WHEN API integration is requested THEN the system SHALL use MCP HTTP tools to test endpoints and generate working API client code
3. WHEN external services are integrated THEN the system SHALL generate proper error handling and retry logic based on actual service responses
4. WHEN database schemas are accessed THEN the system SHALL generate TypeScript types that match the actual database structure
5. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL create interfaces based on real response data rather than assumptions
6. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate authentication flows using MCP security tools

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with external services, I want the app generator to provide real-time preview capabilities that show actual data from connected services, so that I can see how my application will work with live data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN previewing generated applications THEN the system SHALL use MCP tools to fetch real data for display in the preview environment
2. WHEN database connections are configured THEN the system SHALL show actual database records in the preview interface
3. WHEN API integrations are set up THEN the system SHALL display live API responses in the component preview
4. WHEN external services are slow or unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading states and error handling in the preview
5. WHEN data updates occur THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes in real-time within the preview environment
6. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL use MCP tools to simulate actual backend operations like creating, updating, or deleting data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer configuring integrations, I want the app generator to automatically discover and suggest relevant MCP tools based on my application requirements, so that I can easily connect to the services I need without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user prompts THEN the system SHALL identify potential integration opportunities and suggest relevant MCP tools
2. WHEN specific services are mentioned (e.g., "connect to PostgreSQL", "fetch from REST API") THEN the system SHALL automatically configure and test appropriate MCP tools
3. WHEN MCP tools are available THEN the system SHALL present a user-friendly interface for configuring connection parameters
4. WHEN tool configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL validate connections and provide feedback on successful integration
5. WHEN multiple tools could serve the same purpose THEN the system SHALL recommend the most appropriate tool based on the specific use case
6. WHEN MCP tools require authentication THEN the system SHALL guide users through the authentication setup process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using MCP-enhanced code generation, I want the system to generate robust, production-ready code that includes proper error handling, logging, and monitoring for all external integrations, so that my applications are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP tools are integrated THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive error handling for all external service calls
2. WHEN external services fail THEN the generated code SHALL include appropriate fallback mechanisms and user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL generate code that handles rate limiting gracefully with exponential backoff
4. WHEN database connections are used THEN the system SHALL generate proper connection pooling and transaction management code
5. WHEN external services are integrated THEN the system SHALL include logging and monitoring code to track service health and performance
6. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL generate automatic token refresh mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with sensitive data, I want the MCP integration to handle security and privacy concerns appropriately, so that my generated applications follow security best practices when connecting to external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL generate code that stores sensitive information securely using environment variables
2. WHEN making external API calls THEN the system SHALL generate code that validates SSL certificates and uses secure connection protocols
3. WHEN processing user data THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate data validation and sanitization code
4. WHEN storing data externally THEN the system SHALL generate code that follows data privacy regulations and best practices
5. WHEN MCP tools access sensitive services THEN the system SHALL implement proper access controls and audit logging
6. WHEN generating API keys or tokens THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on secure storage and rotation practices
